# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that enables you to build full-stack web applications. It's built on top of React and provides additional features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js offers several advantages over plain React:

- **Zero Configuration**: Start building immediately without complex setup
- **Hybrid Rendering**: Choose between SSR, SSG, or client-side rendering per page
- **File-based Routing**: Pages are automatically routed based on file structure
- **API Routes**: Build API endpoints alongside your frontend
- **Built-in Optimization**: Automatic code splitting, image optimization, and more

## Installation

Getting started with Next.js is simple:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Project Structure

A typical Next.js project has this structure:

```
my-app/
├── app/
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── globals.css
├── public/
├── next.config.js
└── package.json
```

## Creating Your First Page

In the App Router, create a new page by adding a `page.tsx` file:

```tsx
export default function About() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Page</h1>
      <p>This is the about page.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Styling

Next.js supports various styling approaches:

- **CSS Modules**: Scoped CSS with `.module.css` files
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Styled Components**: CSS-in-JS library
- **Global CSS**: Traditional CSS files

## Deployment

Deploy your Next.js app easily with Vercel:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

Next.js makes building modern web applications a breeze with its powerful features and excellent developer experience.
